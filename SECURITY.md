# Security Checklist for Public Repository

This document confirms that the repository has been audited and is safe for public release.

## ✅ Security Audit Completed

### Files Excluded from Git
- ✅ All `.env` files are properly gitignored
- ✅ All database files (`.db`, `.sqlite`) are gitignored
- ✅ All backup files (`.backup`, `.bak`) are gitignored
- ✅ All key files (`.key`, `.pem`) are gitignored
- ✅ Virtual environments (`venv/`, `node_modules/`) are gitignored

### Code Review
- ✅ No hardcoded real API keys or secrets in source code
- ✅ Default placeholder secrets are clearly marked (e.g., "your-secret-key-change-in-production")
- ✅ Test credentials in code use example.com domain only
- ✅ Example API keys in documentation are clearly marked as dummy/example keys

### Configuration Files
- ✅ `api/api/core/config.py` - Uses environment variables with safe defaults
- ✅ `api/config_dev.py` - Development config with placeholder secrets
- ✅ `env.example` - Template file with no real credentials

### Removed Files
- ✅ `.env.sqlite.backup` - Removed (was gitignored but physically deleted)

### Documentation
- ✅ Documentation files contain example credentials only (clearly marked)
- ✅ Setup guides reference environment variables, not hardcoded values

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Always use `env.example` as a template
2. **Never commit database files** - These may contain sensitive user data
3. **Never commit real credentials** - Use environment variables in production
4. **Rotate keys regularly** - If any key is accidentally exposed, rotate immediately
5. **Use secret management** - In production, use proper secret management systems

## 📝 For Contributors

When adding new features:
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Follow the existing pattern of using placeholder values in code
- Update `env.example` if new environment variables are needed
- Keep test credentials using example.com domain only

## ⚠️ If Credentials Are Accidentally Committed

If you discover that real credentials have been committed:
1. **Immediately rotate/revoke** the exposed credentials
2. Remove them from git history using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. Force push to update remote (coordinate with team first)
4. Update documentation about the incident
