## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Missing authentication on account details | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | No caching for balance data | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TECH-001 | Missing transaction history functionality | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Missing compliance integration | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-002 | Blockchain failure handling | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| PERF-002 | Real-time blockchain calls without caching | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | Incomplete user experience | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Security testing for missing authentication
- Performance testing for balance data caching
- Transaction history functionality testing
- Integration testing for missing features

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Compliance integration testing
- Blockchain failure handling testing
- Performance testing for real-time calls
- User experience testing

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for existing features
- Error handling testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- High risks affecting security and performance - SEC-001, PERF-001, TECH-001

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - DATA-001, PERF-002, BUS-001
- Low risks with monitoring in place - DATA-002

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Security metrics for SEC risks (authentication failures, unauthorized access)
- Performance metrics for PERF risks (response times, cache hit rates)
- Error rates for technical risks (transaction history failures, blockchain errors)
- User experience metrics for business risks (user satisfaction, feature usage)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Authentication mechanisms change
- Performance requirements change
- Transaction history requirements change
- Compliance requirements change
- Blockchain integration changes
