Date: 2025-01-27
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 52/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: No Real Data Aggregation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Service layer returns only mock/empty data
**Impact**: High - Misleading analytics, poor business decisions, user trust issues
**Mitigation**:

- Implement real data aggregation from database
- Add account count calculation from actual data
- Implement transaction volume calculation
- Add success rate calculation logic
- **Testing Focus**: Data accuracy testing, integration testing with real data sources

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 3 risks (1 critical, 2 high)
- Performance: 2 risks (1 high)
- Business: 1 risk (1 medium)

### By Component

- Backend: 4 risks
- Database: 2 risks
- Analytics: 3 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | No real data aggregation | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| TECH-002 | Missing account count aggregation | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| TECH-003 | Missing transaction volume calculation | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | No performance optimization | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Mock data could mislead users | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | Poor business decision making | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Data accuracy testing with real data sources
- Integration testing with database
- Analytics calculation validation
- Mock data detection testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing for analytics queries
- Account count calculation testing
- Transaction volume calculation testing
- Database query optimization testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for analytics endpoints
- Error handling testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - TECH-001
- High risks affecting core functionality - TECH-002, TECH-003, PERF-001

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - DATA-001, BUS-001

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Data accuracy metrics for analytics calculations
- Performance metrics for analytics queries
- Error rates for data aggregation failures
- Business impact metrics for analytics accuracy

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Data sources change
- Analytics requirements change
- Performance requirements change
- Business requirements change
