Date: 2025-01-27
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 44/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: No Real Implementation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - All service methods contain only `pass` statements
**Impact**: High - Complete functionality failure, compliance violations, security risks
**Mitigation**:

- Implement complete KYC verification logic
- Add document validation functionality
- Implement risk assessment algorithms
- Add compliance provider integration
- **Testing Focus**: Complete functionality testing, integration testing with compliance providers

### 2. TECH-002: Endpoint-Service Mismatch

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Endpoints call non-existent service methods
**Impact**: High - Runtime errors, broken API, poor user experience
**Mitigation**:

- Implement missing service methods
- Add proper error handling for missing functionality
- Implement service method stubs with proper responses
- Add integration tests to catch mismatches
- **Testing Focus**: Endpoint-service integration testing, error handling testing

| BUS-001  | Compliance violations | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Complete functionality testing for all KYC methods
- Endpoint-service integration testing
- Error handling testing for missing functionality
- Runtime error scenario testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Security testing for missing authentication
- Performance testing for KYC operations
- Document validation testing
- Risk assessment testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for KYC flow
- Database operation testing
- Compliance testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - TECH-001, TECH-002
- High risks affecting security and functionality - TECH-003, TECH-004, SEC-001, PERF-001

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - DATA-001, BUS-001

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Security metrics for authentication failures
- Performance metrics for KYC operations
- Error rates for KYC failures
- Compliance metrics for regulatory adherence

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Compliance requirements change
- Security requirements change
- Performance requirements change
- Regulatory requirements change
