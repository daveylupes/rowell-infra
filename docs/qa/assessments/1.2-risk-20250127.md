# Risk Profile: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-01-27
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 9
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 58/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Endpoint-Service Mismatch

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Endpoint calls filtering parameters that service doesn't support
**Impact**: High - Runtime errors, broken functionality, poor user experience
**Mitigation**:

- Implement missing filtering functionality in service layer
- Add comprehensive input validation for all filter parameters
- Implement proper error handling for unsupported filters
- Add integration tests to catch endpoint-service mismatches
- **Testing Focus**: Integration testing between endpoints and services, error handling testing

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Endpoint-service mismatch | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| TECH-002 | Missing pagination implementation | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| TECH-003 | Missing filtering capabilities | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | Response time > 200ms for 100 accounts | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Missing balance information | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-002 | Filter validation bypass | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| TECH-004 | Duplicate endpoint definitions | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  |
| PERF-002 | Memory issues with large datasets | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | Poor user experience due to missing features | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Integration testing between endpoints and services
- Error handling testing for unsupported operations
- Endpoint-service contract validation
- Runtime error scenario testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing for 200ms response time requirement
- Pagination functionality testing
- Filtering capability testing
- Load testing with large account datasets

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for account listing
- Balance information retrieval testing
- Filter validation testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - TECH-001
- High risks affecting core functionality - TECH-002, TECH-003, PERF-001

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - DATA-001, PERF-002, BUS-001
- Low risks with monitoring in place - DATA-002, TECH-004

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for PERF risks (response times, memory usage)
- Error rates for technical risks (endpoint failures, service errors)
- User experience metrics for business risks (user satisfaction, feature usage)
- Database performance for data risks (query performance, data accuracy)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New filtering requirements are added
- Performance requirements change
- Database schema changes
- API contract changes
- User experience issues are reported
