Date: 2025-01-27
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 72/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Blockchain Integration Security

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Blockchain integration involves external network calls and cryptographic operations
**Impact**: High - Security vulnerabilities could lead to account compromise, fund loss, or regulatory violations
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive input validation for all blockchain operations
- Use secure key management and storage practices
- Add rate limiting and monitoring for blockchain API calls
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- **Testing Focus**: Security testing with OWASP ZAP, penetration testing of blockchain integration

- API: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Blockchain integration security | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| SEC-002  | API key authentication bypass | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | Account creation timeout | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Account data corruption | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| DATA-002 | Duplicate account creation | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-001 | Database connection failure | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-002 | Country validation bypass | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| BUS-001  | Non-compliance with African regulations | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Security testing for blockchain integration vulnerabilities
- Penetration testing of account creation endpoints
- Input validation testing for all blockchain parameters
- Authentication bypass testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing for 2-second account creation requirement
- API key authentication testing
- Load testing with concurrent account creation requests
- Error handling testing for blockchain failures

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for account creation flow
- Database transaction testing
- Country validation testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - SEC-001
- High risks affecting security - SEC-002

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - PERF-001, DATA-002, TECH-001, BUS-001
- Low risks with monitoring in place - DATA-001, TECH-002

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for PERF risks (account creation response times)
- Security alerts for SEC risks (authentication failures, suspicious activity)
- Error rates for operational risks (database connection failures)
- Business KPIs for business risks (compliance violations)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New blockchain networks are added
- Authentication mechanisms change
- Performance requirements change
- Regulatory requirements change
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
