Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 40/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: No Sandbox Environment Implementation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - No sandbox-specific functionality implemented
**Impact**: High - Complete functionality failure, poor developer experience, testing limitations
**Mitigation**:

- Implement sandbox environment setup
- Add mock data generation system
- Implement sandbox API key management
- Add pre-built test scenarios
- **Testing Focus**: Complete sandbox functionality testing, mock data accuracy testing

## Risk Distribution

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | No sandbox environment implementation | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| TECH-002 | Missing mock data generation | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| TECH-003 | No sandbox API key management | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| TECH-004 | No pre-built test scenarios | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | No sandbox testing framework | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| BUS-001  | Poor developer experience | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Complete sandbox functionality testing
- Mock data accuracy testing
- Sandbox environment setup testing
- API key management testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Test scenario validation testing
- Sandbox testing framework testing
- Performance testing for sandbox operations
- Integration testing with sandbox environment

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for sandbox features
- User experience testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - TECH-001
- High risks affecting core functionality - TECH-002, TECH-003, TECH-004, PERF-001

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - BUS-001

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Sandbox usage metrics
- Developer experience metrics
- Mock data accuracy metrics
- Test scenario success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Sandbox requirements change
- Testing requirements change
- Developer experience requirements change
- Mock data requirements change
