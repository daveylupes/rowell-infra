## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Minor formatting inconsistencies | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| TECH-002 | Some advanced examples could be expanded | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Low Risk Tests

- Documentation accuracy testing
- Link validation testing
- Example code testing
- User experience testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- None identified

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Low risks with monitoring in place - TECH-001, TECH-002

### Accepted Risks

- Documentation maintenance overhead - BUS-001

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Documentation usage metrics
- User feedback on documentation quality
- Example code accuracy metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- API changes require documentation updates
- User feedback indicates documentation issues
- New features require documentation updates
