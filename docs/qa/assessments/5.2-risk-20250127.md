## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Some advanced retry scenarios could be expanded | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  |
| TECH-002 | Additional SDK examples could be added | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Low Risk Tests

- SDK functionality testing
- Example code testing
- Integration testing
- User experience testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- None identified

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Low risks with monitoring in place - TECH-001, TECH-002

### Accepted Risks

- Minor enhancements can be added in future iterations

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- SDK usage metrics
- User feedback on SDK quality
- Example code accuracy metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- API changes require SDK updates
- User feedback indicates SDK issues
- New features require SDK updates
