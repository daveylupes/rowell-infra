## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | Missing balance validation | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| SEC-002  | Missing account ownership validation | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| PERF-001 | Transfer processing timeout | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TECH-001 | Limited error handling for insufficient funds | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Transfer metadata storage | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| DATA-002 | Database transaction management | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-002 | Mock transaction fallback | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  |
| BUS-001  | User experience with failed transfers | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Security testing for balance validation bypass
- Security testing for account ownership validation
- Penetration testing of transfer endpoints
- Authorization testing for account access

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Performance testing for 3-second processing requirement
- Load testing with concurrent transfers
- Error handling testing for insufficient funds
- Blockchain failure testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for transfer creation
- Database transaction testing
- Metadata handling testing
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - SEC-001, SEC-002
- High risks affecting performance - PERF-001

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - TECH-001, DATA-002, BUS-001
- Low risks with monitoring in place - DATA-001, TECH-002

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Security metrics for SEC risks (unauthorized transfers, balance violations)
- Performance metrics for PERF risks (transfer processing times, timeout rates)
- Error rates for technical risks (insufficient funds, blockchain failures)
- User experience metrics for business risks (transfer success rates, user satisfaction)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Security requirements change
- Performance requirements change
- Blockchain integration changes
- Account ownership models change
- Transfer limits change
