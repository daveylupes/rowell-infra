  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Basic error handling present but no sensitive data protection, no authentication, no data encryption"
  performance:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "No performance optimization, no background processing, 5-second requirement not met, no database operations"
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "No error handling in service layer, no fallback mechanisms, no data validation, no transaction management"
