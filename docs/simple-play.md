# The Rowell Story: A Simple Play

> **Making African Payments Simple**

---

## ACT 1: THE PROBLEM - Why Sending Money in Africa is Hard

### Scene 1: The Family Story

**Meet Amara** - She lives in London and sends money home to her mother in Lagos every month.

**What happens today:**
- Amara earns Â£500 and wants to send Â£100 to her mother
- She goes to Western Union
- They charge her Â£10 in fees (10% of her money!)
- Her mother waits 3 days to receive the money
- Her mother loses more money converting at bad rates

**The pain:**
- **Lost Money**: Â£10 gone to fees. That's money for food, school, medicine.
- **Wasted Time**: 3 days waiting. What if it's an emergency?
- **Frustration**: Complicated forms, questions, verification every single time.

### Scene 2: The Business Story

**Meet Kwame** - He owns a small online shop in Accra selling African crafts globally.

**What happens today:**
- Customer in Nairobi wants to buy a $50 basket
- Payment processors charge $5 in fees
- Money takes 2-3 days to reach Kwame
- He needs to verify compliance in every country
- Different payment systems don't talk to each other

**The pain:**
- **High Costs**: 10% of revenue lost to fees
- **Slow Money**: Can't restock because money is delayed
- **Limited Reach**: Can't sell to many African countries - too complex
- **Tech Nightmare**: Would need different systems for each country

### Scene 3: The Developer Story

**Meet Chioma** - She's building a fintech app for African students.

**What happens today:**
- Needs to integrate with Stellar blockchain - 6 weeks of work
- Also needs Hedera - another 6 weeks
- Then needs to handle compliance for Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana - months of work
- Different KYC rules per country (BVN, NIN, SA ID, Ghana Card...)
- By the time she's done, she's spent 6 months and $100,000

**The pain:**
- **Too Complex**: Blockchain integration is hard
- **Too Expensive**: Can't afford the development time
- **Too Slow**: Competitors are moving faster
- **Too Risky**: Compliance mistakes can shut you down

## ACT 2: THE SOLUTION - Rowell Infrastructure

### Scene 1: How Rowell Works (Simple Version)

**Think of Rowell like this:**

Imagine sending an email. You don't need to know how the internet works. You don't care which email provider your friend uses. You just type a message and click send.

**That's what we do for payments:**
- You call our simple API
- We handle all the blockchain complexity
- We route to the right network
- We handle all the compliance
- Money arrives in 3 seconds

**It's that simple.**

### Scene 2: The Family Story - FIXED

**Amara tries Rowell:**
- She opens an app built with Rowell Infrastructure
- Types her mother's phone number
- Enters Â£100
- Clicks send
- **Fee: Â£0.10** (99% cheaper!)
- **Time: 3 seconds** (not 3 days!)
- **Total cost: 10 pence instead of Â£10**

**The result:**
- Her mother gets Â£99.90 instead of Â£90
- Money arrives before Amara finishes her tea
- She saved Â£9.90 that can buy groceries for a week

### Scene 3: The Business Story - FIXED

**Kwame uses Rowell:**
- Customer in Nairobi clicks "Buy Now"
- Payment processes through app built on Rowell
- **Fee: $0.50** (1% instead of 10%)
- **Time: 3 seconds** (instant notification)
- **Works in 20+ African countries** (same simple integration)

**The result:**
- Kwame keeps $49.50 instead of $45
- Money arrives instantly - he can restock today
- He can now sell to all of East Africa
- No technical headaches

### Scene 4: The Developer Story - FIXED

**Chioma uses Rowell:**
- Day 1: Signs up, gets API key
- Day 2: Reads simple documentation
- Day 3: Writes 50 lines of code
- Day 4: Testing in sandbox
- Day 5: Her app is working!

```javascript
// Literally this simple:
const transfer = await rowell.send({
  from: 'student_london',
  to: 'family_lagos',
  amount: '100',
  currency: 'USD'
});
// Done. 3 seconds. It just works.
```

**The result:**
- Built in 1 week, not 6 months
- Spent $0 on blockchain experts
- Compliance handled automatically
- She can focus on her students, not infrastructure
