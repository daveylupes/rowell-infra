## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/accounts/`
- **Service Layer**: `api/api/services/account_service.py`
- **Database Models**: `api/api/models/account.py`
- **API Schemas**: `api/api/schemas/account.py`
- **API Endpoints**: `api/api/api/v1/endpoints/accounts.py`

### Current Implementation Status
Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md, the account service currently returns mock data and needs real implementation:
- Service layer implementation is HIGH PRIORITY
- Database queries need optimization for < 50ms requirement
- Production database setup is MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Technical Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Database Queries**: < 50ms
- **Pagination**: Support for large datasets
- **Filtering**: Multiple filter combinations
- **Caching**: Redis for session and data caching

### Database Design Considerations
- **Indexes**: Optimize for African fintech queries
- **Pagination**: Efficient offset/limit implementation
- **Filtering**: Composite indexes for filter combinations
- **Balance Data**: Real-time balance retrieval from blockchain

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/test_account_service.py`
- **Test standards**: Use pytest framework
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Test coverage**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Performance tests**: Verify 200ms response time requirement
- **Load tests**: Test with 100+ accounts

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: CONCERNS** - The implementation has significant gaps between the story requirements and current code. While the basic listing functionality exists, critical features like filtering, pagination, and performance optimization are missing or incomplete.

**Issues Identified:**
- **Critical**: Endpoint-service mismatch - endpoint calls filtering parameters that service doesn't support
- **High**: Missing pagination implementation
- **High**: Missing filtering capabilities (network, environment, account_type, country_code)
- **Medium**: No performance optimization for 200ms requirement
- **Medium**: Missing balance information in listing response
- **Low**: Duplicate endpoint definitions in the same file

**Strengths:**
- Basic listing functionality works
- Proper error handling and logging
- Good database query structure
- Authentication and authorization implemented

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed - the implementation needs significant development work to meet the story requirements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Good adherence to Python best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Proper separation of concerns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Missing tests for filtering and pagination
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ Only 2 out of 10 acceptance criteria are met

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1**: Returns paginated list of accounts ✗
- **Current State**: No pagination implemented
- **Gap**: Missing limit/offset parameters in service layer

**AC2**: All filters work correctly ✗
- **Current State**: No filtering implemented in service layer
- **Gap**: Endpoint expects filters but service doesn't support them

**AC3**: Response time < 200ms for 100 accounts ✗
- **Current State**: No performance optimization
- **Gap**: Missing database indexing and query optimization

**AC4**: Includes account balance information ✗
- **Current State**: No balance data in listing response
- **Gap**: Balance retrieval not implemented for listing

**AC5**: Proper error handling for invalid filters ✗
- **Current State**: No filter validation
- **Gap**: Missing input validation for filter parameters

**AC6**: Filter by network (stellar, hedera) ✗
- **Current State**: Not implemented
- **Gap**: Missing network filter in service layer

**AC7**: Filter by environment (testnet, mainnet) ✗
- **Current State**: Not implemented
- **Gap**: Missing environment filter in service layer

**AC8**: Filter by account type ✗
- **Current State**: Not implemented
- **Gap**: Missing account type filter in service layer

**AC9**: Filter by country code ✗
- **Current State**: Not implemented
- **Gap**: Missing country code filter in service layer

**AC10**: Include account balances ✗
- **Current State**: Not implemented
- **Gap**: Balance data not included in listing response

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage**: INSUFFICIENT (Estimated 20% coverage)
- **Unit Tests**: Only basic listing test exists
- **Missing Tests**: No tests for filtering, pagination, performance, or error handling
- **Test Design**: Basic test structure is good but incomplete
- **Edge Cases**: No edge case testing for filters or pagination

**Test Quality**: BASIC
- **Given-When-Then**: Basic test structure present
- **Assertions**: Limited assertions, missing filter and pagination validation
- **Error Testing**: No error scenario testing for invalid filters
- **Performance**: No performance testing

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Security**: PASS

- Basic input validation present
- Proper error handling without information leakage

**Performance**: FAIL
- No pagination implementation
- No query optimization
- No performance testing
- Response time requirement not validated

**Reliability**: CONCERNS
- Basic error handling present
- No filter validation could cause runtime errors
- Missing input validation for pagination parameters

**Maintainability**: CONCERNS
- Code structure is good
- Duplicate endpoint definitions need cleanup
- Missing comprehensive error handling for filters

### Security Review

**Security Assessment**: ACCEPTABLE
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication properly implemented
- **Input Validation**: Basic validation present, but missing filter validation
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling without sensitive data exposure
- **Database Security**: Basic transaction management

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Assessment**: FAIL
- **Response Time**: No optimization for 200ms requirement
- **Database**: No indexing strategy for filtering
- **Pagination**: Not implemented, could cause memory issues with large datasets
- **Scalability**: Current implementation won't scale with large account volumes

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during review - significant development work is needed.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-account-listing.yml
