## Technical Requirements

### Data Models
```python
class User(Base):
    id: str
    email: str
    password_hash: str
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    is_active: bool
    is_verified: bool
    email_verified_at: datetime
    last_login: datetime
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class Role(Base):
    id: str
    name: str  # admin, developer, viewer, support
    description: str
    is_active: bool
    created_at: datetime

class Permission(Base):
    id: str
    name: str  # accounts:read, transfers:write, etc.
    resource: str
    action: str
    description: str

class UserRole(Base):
    user_id: str
    role_id: str
    assigned_at: datetime
    assigned_by: str

class RolePermission(Base):
    role_id: str
    permission_id: str
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /auth/register - User registration
POST /auth/login - User login
POST /auth/refresh - Token refresh
POST /auth/logout - User logout
GET /auth/me - Get current user
PUT /auth/me - Update user profile
GET /auth/roles - List available roles
POST /auth/verify-email - Email verification
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers with email/password
2. System sends verification email
3. User verifies email and can login
4. Login returns JWT access token + refresh token
5. Frontend uses access token for API calls
6. Token refresh when access token expires
