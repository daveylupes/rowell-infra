## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/accounts/create`
- **Service Layer**: `api/api/services/account_service.py`
- **Database Models**: `api/api/models/account.py`
- **API Schemas**: `api/api/schemas/account.py`
- **API Endpoints**: `api/api/api/v1/endpoints/accounts.py`

### Current Implementation Status
Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md, the account service currently returns mock data and needs real implementation:
- Service layer implementation is HIGH PRIORITY
- Blockchain integration (Stellar testnet) is HIGH PRIORITY
- Production database setup is MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Technical Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Account Creation**: < 2 seconds
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/test_account_service.py`
- **Test standards**: Use pytest framework
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Test coverage**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Integration tests**: Test real blockchain integration
- **Performance tests**: Verify 2-second creation time requirement
