## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/transfers/{transfer_id}` (already exists but calls non-existent service method)
- **Service Layer**: `api/api/services/transfer_service.py` (needs `get_transfer_status` method)
- **Database Models**: `api/api/models/transaction.py` (existing model)
- **API Schemas**: `api/api/schemas/transaction.py` (existing schemas)
- **API Endpoints**: `api/api/api/v1/endpoints/transfers.py` (existing endpoint)
- **Blockchain Services**: `api/api/services/stellar_service.py`, `api/api/services/hedera_service.py`

### Current Implementation Status
Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md and validation analysis:
- Transfer status endpoint exists but calls non-existent `get_transfer_status` method
- Service layer implementation is HIGH PRIORITY
- Blockchain integration needs real implementation
- Compliance framework is completed but needs integration
- Database models and schemas are complete

### Technical Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests [Source: tech-stack.md#performance]
- **Real-time Data**: Transfer status should be current from blockchain
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed status data [Source: tech-stack.md#caching]
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of blockchain failures
- **Logging**: Structured logging with context [Source: backend-architecture.md#logging]

### Service Layer Implementation Pattern
Based on backend architecture service layer pattern [Source: backend-architecture.md#service-layer-design]:

```python
class TransferService:
    def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession, stellar_service: StellarService, hedera_service: HederaService):
        self.db = db
        self.stellar_service = stellar_service
        self.hedera_service = hedera_service
    
    async def get_transfer_status(self, transfer_id: str) -> Optional[TransferStatus]:
        """Get comprehensive transfer status information"""
        # Implementation needed
        pass
```

### Database Integration
Using existing Transaction model [Source: backend-architecture.md#database-models]:
- Transaction model already exists with required fields
- Need to add status tracking and event history
- Use async SQLAlchemy for database operations

### Blockchain Integration
Based on tech stack blockchain integration [Source: tech-stack.md#blockchain-technologies]:
- **Stellar**: Use Horizon API for transaction status
- **Hedera**: Use Mirror Node API for transaction status
- Implement proper error handling for network failures
- Add retry logic for failed blockchain queries

### Caching Strategy
Using Redis caching patterns [Source: tech-stack.md#caching]:
```python
CACHE_PATTERNS = {
    "transfer_status": "transfer_status:{transfer_id}",
}
CACHE_TTL = {
    "transfer_status": 300,  # 5 minutes
}
```

### Error Handling
Following backend architecture error handling patterns [Source: backend-architecture.md#error-handling]:
- Use custom RowellException classes
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Add structured logging for all errors
- Include graceful degradation for service failures

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/test_transfer_service.py`
- **Test standards**: Use pytest framework [Source: backend-architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Test coverage**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Integration tests**: Test real blockchain integration
- **Performance tests**: Verify 200ms response time requirement
- **Error handling tests**: Test non-existent transfers and blockchain failures

### Performance Considerations
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Database**: Optimize queries with proper indexing
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed status data
- **Blockchain**: Handle slow blockchain responses gracefully
- **Concurrent Requests**: Support multiple simultaneous status requests
