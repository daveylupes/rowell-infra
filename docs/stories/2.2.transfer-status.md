### Current Implementation Status
Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md:
- Transfer service implementation is HIGH PRIORITY
- Blockchain integration needs real implementation
- Compliance framework is completed but needs integration
- Service layer currently returns mock data

### Technical Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Real-time Data**: Transfer status should be current
- **Event History**: Support for large event volumes
- **Compliance**: Real-time compliance status
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of blockchain failures

### Blockchain Integration
- **Stellar**: Use Horizon API for transaction status
- **Hedera**: Use Mirror Node API for transaction status
- **Caching**: Cache transaction status for performance
- **Fallback**: Handle blockchain network issues gracefully

### Database Design
- **Transfer Status**: Store transfer status and metadata
- **Event Index**: Pre-indexed events for fast retrieval
- **Compliance Data**: Store compliance status and history
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/test_transfer_service.py`
- **Test standards**: Use pytest framework
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Test coverage**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Integration tests**: Test real blockchain integration
- **Performance tests**: Verify 200ms response time requirement
- **Error handling tests**: Test non-existent transfers and blockchain failures

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: FAIL** - The implementation has significant gaps with critical missing functionality. The endpoint-service mismatch and missing core features make this story incomplete.

**Issues Identified:**
- **Critical**: Endpoint-service mismatch - endpoint calls non-existent `get_transfer_status` method
- **High**: Missing blockchain integration for status checking
- **High**: No event tracking or history functionality
- **High**: No compliance integration with transfer status
- **Medium**: Missing fee information in status response
- **Low**: Limited error handling for status retrieval

**Strengths:**
- Basic transfer retrieval functionality exists
- Good database query structure
- Proper error handling for non-existent transfers
- Good test coverage for basic functionality

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed - the implementation needs significant development work to meet the story requirements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Good adherence to Python best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Proper separation of concerns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Missing tests for status-specific functionality
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ Only 2 out of 10 acceptance criteria are met

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1**: Returns accurate transfer status ✗
- **Current State**: No transfer status service method implemented
- **Gap**: Missing `get_transfer_status` method in service layer

**AC2**: Shows blockchain transaction hash ✓
- **Implementation**: Transaction hash included in transfer retrieval
- **Tests**: Hash retrieval tested in `test_get_transfer_by_hash_success()`

**AC3**: Includes transfer event history ✗
- **Current State**: No event tracking implemented
- **Gap**: Missing event history functionality

**AC4**: Displays compliance status ✗
- **Current State**: No compliance integration with transfer status
- **Gap**: Missing compliance status in status response

**AC5**: Shows fee breakdown ✗
- **Current State**: Fee information not included in status response
- **Gap**: Missing fee breakdown functionality

**AC6**: Handles non-existent transfers gracefully ✓
- **Implementation**: Proper 404 error handling in endpoint
- **Tests**: Non-existent transfer handling tested in `test_get_transfer_not_found()`

**AC7**: Returns transfer status and details ✗
- **Current State**: No comprehensive status service
- **Gap**: Missing status service implementation

**AC8**: Show transaction hash ✓
- **Implementation**: Transaction hash available in transfer data
