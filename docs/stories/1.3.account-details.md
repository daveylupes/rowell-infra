### Current Implementation Status
Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md:
- Service layer implementation is HIGH PRIORITY
- Blockchain integration (Stellar testnet) is HIGH PRIORITY
- Transaction indexing is completed but needs real blockchain integration
- Compliance framework is completed but needs integration

### Technical Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Real-time Data**: Balance data should be current
- **Transaction History**: Support for large transaction volumes
- **Compliance**: Real-time compliance status
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of blockchain failures

### Blockchain Integration
- **Stellar**: Use Horizon API for account data and balances
- **Hedera**: Use Mirror Node API for account data and balances
- **Caching**: Cache balance data for performance
- **Fallback**: Handle blockchain network issues gracefully

### Database Design
- **Account Data**: Store account metadata and basic info
- **Transaction Index**: Pre-indexed transactions for fast retrieval
- **Compliance Data**: Store compliance status and history
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/test_account_service.py`
- **Test standards**: Use pytest framework
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Test coverage**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Integration tests**: Test real blockchain integration
- **Performance tests**: Verify 200ms response time requirement
- **Error handling tests**: Test non-existent accounts and blockchain failures

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: CONCERNS** - The implementation has partial functionality with significant gaps. Basic account details and balance retrieval work well, but critical features like transaction history and compliance integration are missing.

**Issues Identified:**
- **High**: Missing transaction history functionality
- **High**: No compliance/KYC integration with account details
- **Medium**: Missing authentication on account details endpoint
- **Medium**: No caching for balance data performance
- **Low**: Limited error handling for blockchain failures

**Strengths:**
- Basic account retrieval works well
- Account balance integration with blockchain services
- Good error handling for non-existent accounts
- Proper database query structure
- Comprehensive test coverage for existing functionality

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed - the implementation needs additional development work to meet the story requirements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Good adherence to Python best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Proper separation of concerns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Good test coverage for implemented features
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ Only 5 out of 9 acceptance criteria are met

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1**: Returns complete account information ✓
- **Implementation**: `AccountService.get_account()` returns comprehensive account data
- **Tests**: `test_get_account_success()` validates complete information

**AC2**: Includes real-time balance data ✓
- **Implementation**: `AccountService.get_account_balances()` integrates with blockchain services
- **Tests**: `test_get_account_balances_stellar()`, `test_get_account_balances_hedera_mock()`

**AC3**: Shows recent transaction history ✗
- **Current State**: No transaction history functionality implemented
- **Gap**: Missing transaction history service and endpoint

**AC4**: Displays compliance and KYC status ✗
- **Current State**: Compliance service exists but not integrated with account details
- **Gap**: No integration between account details and compliance endpoints

**AC5**: Handles non-existent accounts gracefully ✓
- **Implementation**: Proper 404 error handling in endpoint and service
- **Tests**: `test_get_account_not_found()`, `test_get_account_balances_account_not_found()`

**AC6**: Include account balances ✓
- **Implementation**: Separate balance endpoint and service method
- **Tests**: Comprehensive balance testing for both networks

**AC7**: Show transaction history ✗
