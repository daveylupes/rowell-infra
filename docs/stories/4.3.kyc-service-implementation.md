## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/compliance/kyc/verify` (already exists but calls placeholder methods)
- **Service Layer**: `api/api/services/compliance_service.py` (needs real implementation)
- **Database Models**: `api/api/models/compliance.py` (existing model)
- **API Schemas**: `api/api/schemas/compliance.py` (existing schemas)
- **API Endpoints**: `api/api/api/v1/endpoints/compliance.py` (existing endpoint)

### Current Implementation Status
Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md and validation analysis:
- Compliance framework is completed but needs real implementation
- KYC verification system is modular and ready for implementation
- Africa-specific ID support is implemented in schemas but needs service logic
- Risk scoring system is automated in design but needs implementation
- Compliance reports can be generated but need real data

### Technical Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 5 seconds for KYC verification [Source: tech-stack.md#performance]
- **ID Validation**: Real-time ID format validation using country-specific rules
- **Sanctions Checking**: Integration with external sanctions databases
- **Risk Scoring**: Automated risk assessment with configurable thresholds
- **Compliance Tracking**: Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- **Document Processing**: Support for document upload and validation

### African Compliance Requirements
Based on tech stack African compliance configuration [Source: tech-stack.md#compliance]:

```python
AFRICAN_COMPLIANCE = {
    'NG': {
        'kyc_required': True,
        'id_types': ['BVN', 'NIN', 'Passport'],
        'limits': {
            'daily': 500000,  # NGN
            'monthly': 10000000,  # NGN
        }
    },
    'KE': {
        'kyc_required': True,
        'id_types': ['National ID', 'Passport'],
        'limits': {
            'daily': 150000,  # KES
            'monthly': 3000000,  # KES
        }
    }
}
```

### Service Layer Implementation Pattern
Based on backend architecture service layer pattern [Source: backend-architecture.md#service-layer-design]:

```python
class ComplianceService:
    def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession, cache_service: CacheService):
        self.db = db
        self.cache_service = cache_service
    
    async def initiate_kyc_verification(self, kyc_data: KYCVerificationRequest) -> KYCVerificationResponse:
        """Initiate KYC verification process"""
        # Implementation needed - replace pass statement
        pass
    
    async def get_kyc_status(self, verification_id: str) -> KYCStatusResponse:
        """Get KYC verification status"""
        # Implementation needed - replace pass statement
        pass
```

### Database Integration
Using existing Compliance model from backend architecture:
- Compliance model already exists with required fields
- Need to add KYC verification tracking and status
- Use async SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Implement proper transaction management

### External API Integration
For sanctions checking and ID validation:
- **OFAC API**: US Treasury sanctions list
- **UN Sanctions**: United Nations sanctions database
- **Local APIs**: Country-specific ID validation services
- **KYC Providers**: Third-party KYC verification services
- Implement proper API key management and rate limiting

### Risk Scoring Algorithm
Implement multi-factor risk assessment:
- **ID Validity Score**: Based on format validation and checksums
- **Sanctions Score**: Based on sanctions database matches
- **History Score**: Based on previous verification attempts
- **Document Score**: Based on document authenticity checks
- **Geographic Score**: Based on country risk factors

### Caching Strategy
Using Redis caching patterns [Source: tech-stack.md#caching]:
```python
CACHE_PATTERNS = {
    "kyc_status": "kyc_status:{verification_id}",
    "sanctions_check": "sanctions:{id_hash}",
    "risk_score": "risk_score:{user_id}",
}
CACHE_TTL = {
    "kyc_status": 3600,      # 1 hour
    "sanctions_check": 86400, # 24 hours
    "risk_score": 1800,      # 30 minutes
}
```

### Error Handling
Following backend architecture error handling patterns [Source: backend-architecture.md#error-handling]:
- Use custom RowellException classes for compliance-specific errors
- Implement proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- Add structured logging for all KYC operations
- Include graceful degradation for external service failures
- Add circuit breaker patterns for external API calls

### Security and Privacy
Based on tech stack security requirements [Source: tech-stack.md#security]:
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive ID data at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to KYC data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for compliance
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Privacy Controls**: GDPR-compliant data handling

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/test_compliance_service.py`
- **Test standards**: Use pytest framework [Source: backend-architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Test coverage**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Integration tests**: Test with real KYC providers (sandbox mode)
- **Security tests**: Test data protection and encryption
- **Compliance tests**: Test regulatory compliance scenarios
- **Performance tests**: Verify 5-second verification requirement

### Performance Considerations
- **Response Time**: < 5 seconds for KYC verification
- **External APIs**: Handle slow external service responses
- **Database**: Optimize queries with proper indexing
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data (sanctions lists, risk scores)
- **Concurrent Requests**: Support multiple simultaneous verifications
- **Background Processing**: Use Celery for long-running verification tasks
