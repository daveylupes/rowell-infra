NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.1-nfr-20250127.md

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Missing critical security features (balance validation, account ownership validation) must be addressed before this story can be considered complete. The implementation is solid but needs these security enhancements.
