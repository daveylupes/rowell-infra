- **API Endpoints**: `api/api/api/v1/endpoints/transfers.py`

### Current Implementation Status
Based on PROJECT_STATUS.md:
- Transfer service implementation is HIGH PRIORITY
- Database queries need optimization for large volumes
- Service layer currently returns mock data
- Pagination and filtering not implemented

### Technical Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Database Queries**: < 50ms
- **Pagination**: Support for large datasets
- **Filtering**: Multiple filter combinations
- **Caching**: Redis for session and data caching

### Database Design Considerations
- **Indexes**: Optimize for transfer queries (account, status, network, date)
- **Pagination**: Efficient offset/limit implementation
- **Filtering**: Composite indexes for filter combinations
- **Sorting**: Optimized indexes for sorting by date, amount, status

### Performance Requirements
- **Large Datasets**: Support for millions of transfers
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient database queries
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed transfer data
- **Pagination**: Handle large result sets efficiently

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/test_transfer_service.py`
- **Test standards**: Use pytest framework
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Test coverage**: 90%+ code coverage required
- **Performance tests**: Verify 200ms response time requirement
- **Load tests**: Test with large transfer volumes
- **Filter tests**: Test all filter combinations
